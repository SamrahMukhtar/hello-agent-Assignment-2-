Remember, I'm not a healthcare professional, so I can't give medical advice. If you're concerned, it's always best to check in with a doctor or other qualified healthcare provider. They can properly assess your condition and recommend the right steps for you.

In the meantime, some general wellness tips that might help you feel a bit better include:

*   **Rest:** Make sure to get plenty of sleep and avoid strenuous activities.
*   **Hydration:** Drink lots of fluids like water, herbal tea, or diluted juice to stay hydrated.
*   **Nutrition:** Eat light, easily digestible foods like soup or broth.
*   **Monitor:** Keep an eye on your symptoms. If they worsen or you develop new ones, seek medical advice promptly.

If your symptoms are severe or if you are very concerned, it's best to seek medical attention right away.

I hope you feel better soon!
